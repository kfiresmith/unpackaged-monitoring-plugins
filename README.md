# unpackaged-monitoring-plugins
A holding pen for various monitoring plugins from disparate sources and authors

## Content Origins
The checks within this repo are collected from various non-VCS locations, and were written by random sysadmins who may have posted the checks in online help forums or other locations that are not as easy to pull from or refer to as a Git repo.

When possible, I try to track down check authors and encourage them to submit their checks to [https://monitoring-plugins.org], but often the checks are abandoned by their original authors.  

The goal of this repo is to compile these checks and archive them for posterity.

## Are you a check author?
If you wrote one of the checks in this repo - thanks!  

If you object for some reason to my including your content here, please drop me a line and I'll remove your check and optionally include a pointer to it if you have it hosted elsewhere and wish for people to continue using it.
